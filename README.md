# pyro-client
Pyro Client is a booter that uses ICMP Echo Requests (also called "pings") to fill the victim's bandwidth with large amounts of packets and stress their network.

This program may set off SmartScreen, that's only because your computer doesn't recognise where this program came from.

# TOS
###### 1. Do not redistribute.
###### 2. The creator is not liable for any damage for what ever reason that happens to any device during the use of this program.
###### 3. This should only be used for the testing of network security, and not if someone made you mad on Call of Duty.

# Instructions

Once you start the program you are greeted with a GUI. There will be three numbers.

Press one of the number keys corresponding with your choice on the menu.

Once you press it you are automatically taken to the menu you chose.

If you are to press one, it will prompt you for an IPv4 IP address. Enter the victim's IP and then press enter.

The program will then proceed to ping the victim many times per second.

**Note: It's more effective if multiple attacks are running at once.**
