# pyro-client
Pyro Client is a booter that uses ICMP Echo Requests (also called "pings") to fill the victim's bandwidth with large amounts of packets and stress their network.

This program may set off SmartScreen, that's only because your computer doesn't recognise where this program came from.

There's no real instructions on how to use it, just make sure you extract it after downloading.
